## Chapter 1: What is JavScript?
JavScript is a very versatile language because it supports both object-oriented and 
procedural programming to bring interactivity to a Web page. On top of this, due
to its flexibility, it allowed developers to write several wellknown tools (also known libraries) that provide robust solutions with little extra effort. 
Under the hood, these libraries are a combination of
variable declarations, arithmetic, and conditional operators, iteration loops, functions,
and event responses.
### Variables, mathematical operations, and string concatenation
JavScript enforces some rules on variable naming. 
For example, a valid variable name cannot start with a number (although numbers are allowed inside a variable name), 
it cannot contain spaces, arthmetic, Boolean operations, or punctuation signs. Reserved keyword must avoid. 
A variable can be decalared and given a value in two separate steps, which are displayed as follows:
```javscript
var myTeam;
myTeam = 'Chicago Bulls';  
```
value in a single step, as follows:
```javscript 
var myTeam = 'Chicago Bulls';
```
